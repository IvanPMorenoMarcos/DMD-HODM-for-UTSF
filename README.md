# Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-for-one-step-ahead-univariate-time-series-forecasting
The main objective of this repository is understand How a model DMD model works?, How can I tune its parameters? and How can I apply it properly in a one-step ahead univariate time series forecasting? using a implementation from https://github.com/mathLab/PyDMD
